I am a first-year PhD student in Psychology at Stanford University, advised by [Tobi Gerstenberg](http://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"} in the [Causality in Cognition Lab](http://cicl.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} and supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}. I received my BS degrees (virtually!) from MIT studying math, computer science, and cognitive science. At MIT, I also worked in the [CoCoSci](http://cocosci.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} group with [Max Kleiman-Weiner](http://www.mit.edu/~maxkw/){:target="_blank"} and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are in computational modeling of social cognition, including aspects of social learning, inference, and judgement. Outside of science, I like boba, running, music, and design.
